# **Goal**
Object detection of solar radio bursts.


# **Background**
Solar radio bursts are short periods during which the Sun's radio emission is elevated above the background level. They are signatures of the same underlying physical processes that lead to the more widely-known forms of solar activity such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

Solar radio bursts are classified pincipally on their appearance in a dynamic spectrum from radiospectrographs, that is primarily on how a burst's frequency drifts over time. There are five main types of solar radio bursts, namely types I to V. 

# **Motivation**
Measuring solar activity through radio observations is a key indicator for monitoring and prediciting space weather. The main advantage of ground-based radio observations over optical ones of the Sun is that the former is unaffected by clouded skies. Keeping an eye on space weather is essential since it can have dire consequences on our satellites (communication, navigation, ...), astronaut safety, airline travellers, electrical grid, and others which are ubiqutous in today's digital era.

# **Future works**
* Sourcing more data spanning whole operational time of instrument
* Address potential under-representation of certain classes through synthetic spectras
* Hyperparameter fine tuning
* Ensemble model (2 AIs or 1 AI with 1 non-AI)
* Unsupervised clustering
